# Three.js + Next.js + Tailwind CSS Project

This is a 3D web application project using:

- Next.js for the React framework
- Three.js for 3D graphics (vanilla implementation)
- Tailwind CSS for styling

When providing code suggestions:

- Prefer modern React practices (hooks, functional components)
- Use vanilla Three.js for 3D graphics (not React Three Fiber)
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling components
- Consider client-side rendering needs for Three.js components
- Follow Next.js best practices, especially regarding App Router

Common operations in this codebase:

- Creating new 3D objects/scenes
- Adding animations and interactions
- Optimizing Three.js performance
- Implementing responsive 3D experiences
